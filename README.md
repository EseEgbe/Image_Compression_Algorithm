# Image_Compression_Algorithm
The **Image_Compression_Algorithm** is a project carried out during my **Software Engineering program** at **ALX**.

## Fundamentals of The Algorithm
* The human eye is fairly sensitive to brightness changes, yet fairly indifferent to chromaticity variations.
* In areas of strong brightness, the human eye is relatively sensitive to the borders of things, but generally insensitive to interior darkness.
* Some fine color variations in the high-frequency part are difficult for the human eye to distinguish.

## Project Goal
The project goal is to write an optimized image compression algorithm.
The image compression algorithm decreases the size and pixel counts while preserving the significance and clarity of images.

## Demonstration
The compression ratio indicates how many times the original image is compressed.
#### "Image - 3.01 mb"

#### "Compressed Image - 2.15 mb"

#### Compression Ratio: 1.4 Times

#### "Image - 4.41 mb"

#### Compression Ratio: 1.44 Times
